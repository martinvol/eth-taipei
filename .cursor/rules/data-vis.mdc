# Data Visualization Guidelines

- This project uses Recharts 2.15.2 for data visualization
- When creating charts:
  - Use appropriate chart types for the data being displayed
  - Implement responsive designs that work across screen sizes
  - Include proper legends, labels, and tooltips
  - Ensure accessibility with appropriate ARIA attributes
  - Use consistent colors from the project's theme
- Format data appropriately before passing to chart components
- Use date-fns for date formatting and manipulation
- Implement proper loading states and error handling
- For complex visualizations:
  - Break down into smaller, reusable components
  - Consider performance implications with large datasets
  - Implement virtualization or pagination when necessary
