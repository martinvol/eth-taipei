# Code Quality Standards

- This project uses ESLint for linting and Prettier for formatting
- Run linting with `npm run lint`
- Format code with `npm run format`
- Follow these coding standards:
  - Use meaningful variable and function names
  - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
  - Write comments for complex logic
  - Use consistent indentation and spacing
  - Limit line length to improve readability
- For imports:
  - Group imports logically (React, third-party, internal)
  - Use absolute imports for project files
  - Avoid circular dependencies
- For error handling:
  - Use try/catch blocks appropriately
  - Provide meaningful error messages
  - Log errors for debugging
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Optimize for performance:
  - Memoize expensive calculations
  - Avoid unnecessary re-renders
  - Use appropriate React optimization techniques
