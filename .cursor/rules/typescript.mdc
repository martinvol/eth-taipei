# TypeScript Standards

- This project uses TypeScript 5.2.2
- Enforce strict type checking
- Define explicit return types for functions, especially for exported functions
- Use interface for object types that will be extended, and type for unions, primitives, and object types that won't be extended
- Prefer readonly properties when the value shouldn't be mutated
- Use type inference when the type is obvious
- For React components:
  - Define prop types using interfaces
  - Use React.FC<Props> type sparingly (prefer explicit return types)
- Avoid using 'any' type; use 'unknown' when the type is truly unknown
- Utilize TypeScript utility types (Partial, Required, Pick, Omit, etc.) when appropriate
- Create and use type definitions for API responses and requests
