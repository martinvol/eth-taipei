# React Component Guidelines

- This project uses React 18.2.0
- Prefer functional components with hooks over class components
- Follow component naming conventions:
  - Use PascalCase for component names
  - Use camelCase for functions and variables
- Structure components with a clear separation of concerns:
  - Props interface/type at the top
  - Hooks and state declarations next
  - Helper functions
  - Return statement with JSX
- Implement proper error boundaries around complex component trees
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization when appropriate
- Leverage React.Suspense and React.lazy() for code splitting
- When using hooks:
  - Follow the rules of hooks
  - Use custom hooks to abstract reusable logic
  - Properly manage dependencies in useEffect
