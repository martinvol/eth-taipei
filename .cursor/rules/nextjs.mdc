# Next.js Framework Guidelines

- This project uses Next.js version 15.2.4
- Use the App Router pattern for new components and pages
- Follow Next.js best practices for data fetching:
  - Use Server Components where possible
  - Implement proper data fetching strategies (SSR, ISR, CSR) based on content needs
  - Leverage React Server Components for improved performance
- When creating new pages or components:
  - Place page components in the app/ directory
  - Follow the routing conventions of Next.js App Router
  - Use layout.tsx files for shared layouts
- For client-side navigation, use the Next.js Link component instead of regular anchor tags
- Utilize next/image for optimized image loading
- Use next-themes for theme management
