# Tailwind CSS Guidelines

- This project uses Tailwind CSS 3.4.1
- Follow a mobile-first approach with responsive design
- Use Tailwind's utility classes directly in components rather than creating custom CSS
- For component styling:
  - Group related utilities with appropriate spacing
  - Use consistent ordering of utilities (layout, typography, visual, etc.)
  - Leverage the clsx/tailwind-merge libraries for conditional styling
- Utilize the class-variance-authority package for creating component variants
- For animations, use the tailwindcss-animate plugin
- When styling is complex:
  - Consider extracting common patterns to components
  - Use @apply in CSS files sparingly and only for repeated patterns
- Follow the project's color scheme and design system
- Use Tailwind's theme extension in tailwind.config.js for custom values
